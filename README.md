# SUSHI-experiments-closure72

## About

This repository contains a snapshot of the [Defects4J](https://github.com/rjust/defects4j) source code repository 
for bug number 72 of the Google Closure compiler. In turns, the Defect4J repository contains a snapshot of the 
[Google Closure compiler](https://github.com/google/closure-compiler) source code repository. The only code we 
added to this third-party software is contained in the sushi/ folder.

## Checking out the project

This repository contains an Eclipse project that is configured to work together with the Eclipse projects for 
[SUSHI](https://github.com/pietrobraione/sushi) and [SUSHI-lib](https://github.com/pietrobraione/sushi-lib). 
Install Eclipse and the EGit plugin, then import in the same workspace the projects for SUSHI-lib and SUSHI by 
following the instructions in their respective README files. Fix the dependencies for the SUSHI project (again, 
refer to the README file). Finally, import this repository in the same workspace by following the same instructions 
as for the other projects (on the Eclipse main menu select File > Import..., in the dialog that pops up select 
Projects from Git, insert the URI of this repository, and when asked for a wizard for importing projects answer 
Import Existing Eclipse Projects).

## Launching the experiments

The project contains Eclipse launch configurations that can be used to launch the experiments. The launch configurations 
are the files sushi-src/Sushi_Closure72_accurate.launch (with accurate invariants) and 
sushi-src/Sushi_Closure72_partial.launch (with partial invariants).

## Gathering the results

All the temporary files generated by SUSHI, including a dump of the console output of SUSHI (dump.txt), will reside 
in a subdirectory of the sushi-out/ folder that will have as name the date and time when SUSHI was launched. The 
generated tests will be put in the sushi-test/ source folder (note that multiple runs of SUSHI might overwrite 
the tests generated by previous runs).
